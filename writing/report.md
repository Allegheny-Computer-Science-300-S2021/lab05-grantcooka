#### Part 1.


 1. Which software did you use to conduct your analysis?

 I used the interactive demo to conduct the analysis.

 2. How similar were the two sequences (`s1.fasta` and `s2.fasta`) which you applied an alignment program?

 The two sequences are pretty similar. The algorithm was able to detect a score of 10. They also have very few mismatches.


 3. Are the two sequences closely related to each other, in your opinion?

 In my opinion, it is hard to say. There are segments in which it leads me to believe that they are closely related. However, I don't quite know if this is due to horizontal gene transfer.


 4. What proof do you have to suggest such a claim?


 The score of 10 leads me to believe that they are somewhat closely related. But I am still unsure if this is a cases where it was by chance or through horizontal gene sharing.




#### Part 2
 1. How much similarity exists between each of the sequences to the others?

All of the given sequences seem to represent a higher similarity between each other. The average similarity among them is equal to 96.2%.


 2. Based on your results so far (which are too few to provide a comprehensive study), do you believe there is evidence that human adaptation is occurring in H5N1 viruses that might merit concern about human-to-human transmission in the near future?


I believe so. They all have a high similarity, but due to horizontal gene transfer and other mutations, I believe that it has a higher chance of faster adaptation toward human intervention. Which would make it harder to fight against this pathogen.

 3. Statistics: What were the numbers of Lengths, Similarities, Gaps and Scores for each of your alignment tasks?


For results A & B (chicken_viet_nam_10_2005 & china_GD01_2006):
 Length = 1776
 Identity = 95.2% (1690/1776)
 Similarity = 95.2% (1690/1776)
 Gaps = 2.5% (45/1776)
 Score 8286.0

For results A & C (chicken_viet_nam_10_2005 & avian_Hong_Kong_719_2007):
 Length = 1751
 Identity = 96.0% (1681/1751)
 Similarity = 96.0% (1681/1751)
 Gaps = 1.1% (20/1751)
 Score = 8205.0

 For results A & B (china_GD01_2006 & avian_Hong_Kong_719_2007):
 Length = 1776
 Identity = 97.5% (1731/1776)
 Similarity = 97.5% (1731/1776)
 Gaps = 1.4% (25/1776)
 Score 8575.0
